      question: "How do I register for a hackathon or event?",
      answer: "Registering for events on Eventra is simple! Browse available events on our Events or Hackathons pages, click on the event you're interested in, and click the 'Register' or 'Join Event' button. You'll need to create an account if you don't have one. Follow the registration prompts, provide any required information, and you're all set! You'll receive a confirmation email with event details and check-in instructions."
    },

      category: "Event Creation",
      icon: <Calendar className="w-5 h-5" />,
      question: "How can I create and host my own event on Eventra?",
      answer: "Creating your own event is easy! Sign up for an account, navigate to your dashboard, and click 'Create Event' or 'Host Event'. Choose your event type (workshop, hackathon, conference, etc.), fill in the event details like title, description, date, location, and capacity. You can customize registration requirements, add team collaboration features, and set up check-in options. Once published, your event will be visible to the community and you'll have access to management tools and analytics."

      category: "Event Types",
      icon: <BookOpen className="w-5 h-5" />,
      question: "What is the difference between a workshop and a hackathon?",
      answer: "Workshops are typically educational or skill-building sessions focused on learning specific topics, tools, or techniques. They're usually shorter (a few hours to a full day) and more structured. Hackathons are competitive coding events where participants work in teams to build projects within a limited timeframe (usually 24-48 hours). Hackathons emphasize innovation, collaboration, and rapid prototyping, often with prizes and judging involved."

      category: "Pricing",
      icon: <Zap className="w-5 h-5" />,
      question: "Is it free to participate in or create an event?",
      answer: "Yes! Eventra is an open-source platform that's completely free to use for both participants and event organizers. You can join events, create your own events, and access most features without any cost. Some premium features for large-scale events or enterprise users may have associated costs, but the core platform remains free for communities, educational institutions, and individual organizers."

      category: "Community",
      icon: <Users className="w-5 h-5" />,
      question: "How do the community links (Discord, Telegram, etc.) work?",
      answer: "Our community links connect you to various chat platforms where Eventra users gather to discuss events, share opportunities, network, and collaborate. These external communities are managed by volunteers and provide spaces for ongoing conversations beyond individual events. You can join these communities to stay updated on upcoming events, find team members for hackathons, get help with the platform, and connect with like-minded people in your area or field of interest."

      question: "How do I edit my profile and manage my account?",
      answer: "After logging in, click on your profile picture in the top navigation bar and select 'Edit Profile' or access your 'Dashboard'. From there, you can update your personal information, profile picture, bio, interests, and notification preferences. You can also view your event history, manage your created events, and track your participation in the community leaderboard."

      category: "Technical Support",

For persistent issues, you can contact our support team through the Contact page, join our community Discord for real-time help from other users, or check our documentation page for troubleshooting guides.

Our platform handles registration and check-ins for all event types, making it easy to manage diverse event formats."

      id: 9,
      category: "Event Management",
      icon: <Calendar className="w-5 h-5" />,
      question: "How do I manage attendees and check-ins?",
      answer: "Event organizers have access to a comprehensive dashboard with attendee management tools. You can view registration lists, send announcements to participants, generate QR codes for quick check-ins, track attendance in real-time, and export attendee data. The platform also provides analytics on registration patterns, no-shows, and engagement metrics to help you improve future events."
